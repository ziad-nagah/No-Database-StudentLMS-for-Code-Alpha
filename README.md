# No Database StudentLM for CodeAlpha

the data was volatile whent you run the programe you will not find any data and you should try all services in 
one session to not to lose the data in the model i tried as a web developer to make an MVC project but with out view 
as i still beginner in JAVAFX GUI i may make an update for this or transfer the app into web page throw servlet & JSP
depends on Code alpha operation demand every thing is categorized and separated in packages and written in cleancode
# skilles used

long or made with unwanted teckneques
